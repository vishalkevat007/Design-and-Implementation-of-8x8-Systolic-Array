# Design-and-Implentation-of-8x8-Systolic-Array
This repository presents the full design and implementation of an 8Ã—8 systolic array accelerator targeting high-throughput matrix multiplication. It covers both the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) description in Verilog and the subsequent physical design flow, from floorplanning to final layout verification.
